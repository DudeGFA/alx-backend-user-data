### [0x01. Basic authentication](./0x00-personal_data/)
In this project, you will implement a Basic Authentication. You are not allowed to install any other module.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/_ZTQTaMKjx1S_xATshexkA)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.
